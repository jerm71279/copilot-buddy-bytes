-- Fix the remaining infinite recursion in user_roles table
-- The problem: user_roles "Admins can manage user roles" policy is checking user_roles itself

-- Drop the problematic policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can manage user roles" ON user_roles;

-- Recreate with simpler logic that doesn't cause recursion
-- This policy just checks if the current user IS in the admin role, without complex joins
