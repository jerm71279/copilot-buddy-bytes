### ⚠️ Security Warnings from Linter

The database migration triggered 6 security warnings (2 ERRORS, 4 WARNINGS). These are **pre-existing issues** not related to the NinjaOne integration:

1. **ERROR: Security Definer Views** (2 issues)
   - Pre-existing views with SECURITY DEFINER
   - Not created by this migration
   - Need review but don't block deployment

2. **WARN: Function Search Path Mutable** (3 issues)
   - Pre-existing functions
   - Should set search_path for security
   - Low priority for fixing

3. **WARN: Leaked Password Protection Disabled**
   - Auth configuration setting
   - Can be enabled in Supabase dashboard

**Recommendation:** Schedule security review for pre-existing issues, but they don't impact NinjaOne integration.
