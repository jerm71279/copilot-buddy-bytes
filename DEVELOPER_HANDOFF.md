# Developer Handoff Protocol

## 🎯 Purpose

This document outlines the **knowledge transfer process** when a developer transitions off the OberaConnect platform project. Following this protocol ensures continuity, minimizes disruption, and converts individual knowledge into team assets.

## 📋 Handoff Checklist

### Before Departure (2-4 Weeks Notice)

- [ ] **Schedule Handoff Sessions** (minimum 3 sessions)
- [ ] **Record Architecture Walkthrough** (video)
- [ ] **Document Active Work** (in-progress features)
- [ ] **Export Technical Diagrams** (architecture, data flow)
- [ ] **Update All Documentation** (ensure accuracy)
- [ ] **Create Troubleshooting Guide** (known issues)
- [ ] **List External Contacts** (if any third-party integrations)
- [ ] **Transfer Code Ownership** (GitHub permissions)

## 🎥 Recording Requirements

### 1. Architecture Walkthrough (30-45 min)

**Topics to Cover**:
- System overview and design philosophy
- Database schema and relationships
- Key modules and their interactions
- Authentication and RLS policy overview
- Customer customization flow
- Department dashboard architecture
- Integration module organization
- AI assistant and MCP server integration

**Screen Recording Checklist**:
- [ ] Navigate through codebase structure
- [ ] Open key files and explain responsibilities
- [ ] Show database tables in backend UI
- [ ] Demonstrate RLS policies in action
- [ ] Walk through a typical user flow (signup → dashboard)

**Suggested Script**:
```
"I'm going to walk you through the OberaConnect platform architecture. 

First, let's look at the project structure [open src/]. The main entry point is App.tsx, which sets up routing for all our department dashboards...

Now let's look at authentication [open Auth.tsx]. When a user signs up, we create three records: a customer, a user profile, and a customization entry...

[Continue through each major module]"
```

### 2. Key Flows and Logic Decisions (20-30 min)

**Topics to Cover**:
- Why certain design decisions were made
- Tradeoffs considered (e.g., monorepo vs. separate services)
- Complex logic explanations (customization application, RLS policies)
- Performance optimizations implemented
- Security considerations
- Known limitations and workarounds

**Example Walkthrough**:
```
"Let me explain why we use the useCustomerCustomization hook. 

We wanted per-customer branding without deploying new code for each customer. So we store colors in the database and apply them as CSS variables at runtime.

The alternative was using Tailwind's JIT with dynamic classes, but that would require rebuilds. This approach is more flexible...

[Continue with other decisions]"
```

### 3. Common Issues and Solutions (15-20 min)

**Topics to Cover**:
- Most frequent bugs and their fixes
- Debugging techniques used
- Environment-specific issues (dev vs. production)
- Third-party integration quirks
- Performance bottlenecks and solutions

**Example Content**:
```
"Here are the issues I've encountered most often:

1. RLS policy denials: This usually means the user_profile wasn't created properly during signup. Check that the trigger is firing...

2. CSS variables not applying: This happens if customization loads after the component renders. Make sure to check isLoading...

[Continue with other issues]"
```
