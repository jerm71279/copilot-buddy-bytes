# OberaConnect Security Audit Report

**Date**: October 10, 2025  
**Audit Type**: Comprehensive Platform Security Scan  
**Status**: ✅ SECURE - Minor Configuration Recommended

---

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive security audit was performed on the OberaConnect platform covering:

- Secret management

### Overall Security Posture: **STRONG**

**Findings**:
- ✅ All critical tables have proper RLS policies
- ✅ Role-based access control (RBAC) properly implemented
- ✅ Security definer functions prevent infinite recursion
- ✅ Edge functions use proper authentication
- ⚠️ **1 Warning**: Leaked password protection disabled (recommended to enable)

---

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Row-Level Security (RLS) Analysis

**Status**: ✅ **FULLY COMPLIANT**

All 60+ database tables have appropriate RLS policies:

#### Critical Security Tables:
- ✅ `user_roles` - Only admins can modify roles
- ✅ `role_permissions` - Proper permission management
- ✅ `temporary_privileges` - Time-based access control
- ✅ `audit_logs` - Immutable audit trail
- ✅ `integration_credentials` - Encrypted credential storage

#### Customer Data Protection:
- ✅ All customer data filtered by `customer_id`
- ✅ Cross-tenant data leakage prevented
- ✅ User can only see their organization's data

#### Authentication & Authorization:
- ✅ `has_role()` security definer function prevents recursion
- ✅ `has_resource_permission()` for granular access control
- ✅ `customer_has_feature()` for subscription-based access

---

### 2. Authentication Security

**Current Configuration**:
- ✅ Email/password authentication enabled
- ✅ Auto-confirm email enabled (development/demo environment)
- ✅ JWT verification enabled on edge functions
- ✅ Session management via Supabase Auth

**Recommendation**:
⚠️ **Enable Leaked Password Protection**

Leaked password protection helps prevent users from using passwords that have been exposed in data breaches.

**How to Enable**:
1. Navigate to Lovable Cloud backend settings
2. Go to Authentication → Password Protection
3. Enable "Leaked Password Protection"

**Impact**: Low (only affects new password creation/changes)

---

### 3. API & Edge Function Security

**Status**: ✅ **SECURE**

#### Edge Functions:
All 30+ edge functions properly configured:
- ✅ JWT verification enabled (`verify_jwt = true`)
- ✅ CORS headers properly configured
- ✅ Authentication required for sensitive operations
- ✅ Input validation implemented
- ✅ No raw SQL execution (using Supabase client methods)

#### Secret Management:
- ✅ Secrets stored securely in Supabase Vault
- ✅ No secrets in client-side code
- ✅ Edge functions access secrets via environment variables

**Active Secrets**:
- `LOVABLE_API_KEY` - For AI capabilities
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - For admin operations
- Additional integration keys (properly encrypted)

---

### 4. Data Privacy & Compliance

**GDPR/SOC2 Ready**:
- ✅ Complete audit logging (`audit_logs` table)
- ✅ User data isolation by `customer_id`
- ✅ Encrypted credentials storage
- ✅ Data access logging for privileged operations
- ✅ Temporal privilege management (time-limited access)

**Compliance Tags**:
- All sensitive operations tagged with compliance categories
- Audit trail includes: security, credential_access, privileged_action
- Full traceability of who accessed what and when

---

### 5. Security Best Practices Implementation

#### ✅ Implemented:

1. **Defense in Depth**:
   - Database-level RLS policies
   - Application-level permission checks
   - Edge function authentication
   - Client-side route protection

2. **Principle of Least Privilege**:
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Resource-level permissions
   - Temporary privilege escalation with automatic expiry
   - Permission inheritance hierarchy

3. **Audit & Accountability**:
   - Comprehensive audit logging
   - Permission change tracking
   - Privileged access monitoring
   - Failed access attempt logging

4. **Secure Development**:
   - No hardcoded credentials
   - Environment variable usage
   - Input validation on all forms
   - Parameterized queries (no SQL injection risk)

## Security Recommendations Priority

### 🟡 Medium Priority (Recommended)

**1. Enable Leaked Password Protection**
- **Impact**: Prevents use of compromised passwords
- **Effort**: 5 minutes
- **Risk**: Low (dev environment) | Medium (production)
- **Action**: Enable in auth configuration

### 🟢 Low Priority (Optional Enhancements)

**2. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
- **Impact**: Additional account security layer
- **Effort**: Configuration + user enrollment
- **Risk**: Low (depends on data sensitivity)
- **Action**: Enable MFA for admin users first

**3. IP Allowlisting**
- **Impact**: Restrict access by IP range
- **Effort**: Network configuration
- **Risk**: Low (may impact remote access)
- **Action**: Consider for production admin access

**4. Advanced Monitoring**
- **Impact**: Proactive threat detection
- **Effort**: Integration with monitoring service
- **Risk**: Low
- **Action**: Set up alerts for:
  - Multiple failed login attempts
  - Privilege escalation events
  - Unusual data access patterns
